# DragonTweet

<strong>My own version of popular social media app Twitter with a theme modelled after the anime "Dragon Ball Z".</strong>


This app is a clone of Twitter using Ruby on Rails. While the idea is not original, I learnt a lot from building this app - from the basics of Rails framework to more advanced concepts like search function, hashtag functionality etc. I am a fan of the anime "Dragon Ball Z", so I decided to design my app based on characters from the anime.
